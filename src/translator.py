#       opinion, the "would delete text" guard compares across scripts instead
#       of counting characters, the language guard stands down when source and

    # Ollama request/response plumbing.
    #
    # Reasoning ("thinking") is never wanted here: for translation it only
    # burns tokens, and the chain-of-thought leaks straight into the book
    # text. Every single request must therefore go through _ollama_payload,
    # and every response through _strip_reasoning:
    #
    #   * "think": false is Ollama's official switch (docs.ollama.com/
    #     capabilities/thinking) and must be sent explicitly: since Ollama
    #     0.12 a thinking-capable model turns reasoning ON by default when
    #     the field is omitted. Ollama accepts the field for non-thinking
    #     models too, so it is safe to send unconditionally.
    #   * gpt-oss is the documented exception: it ignores the boolean and
    #     its reasoning cannot be switched off at all — only its length,
    #     via the "low"/"medium"/"high" levels. So it gets "low".
    #   * Some reasoning models (deepseek-r1 among them) ignore the switch
    #     and still emit <think>…</think> inline in "response", so the text
    #     is stripped as well.
    #
    # There is no server-side, Modelfile or env-var way to turn reasoning
    # off globally — it is per-request only, hence the single choke point.

        A span is usable only if it occurs in the draft verbatim: everything
        downstream is a literal substring replacement, so a span the model
        re-typed from memory, translated back, or invented has no position to
        patch and is dropped rather than fuzzy-matched. On a local quantised
        model this discards a fair share of the answer, which is the point —
        a dropped error leaves the draft alone, and leaving the draft alone
        is the safe outcome.

        `original_text` is the other text the answer is checked against. A
        replacement that reproduces the source, or that collapses a span to a
        fraction of its length, is dropped on the same principle: it is not an
        improvement to the translation, it is the loss of one. The reader is
        better served by the draft than by either, which is why the fallback
        is always the text that is already there.

        `source_lang` enables the last guard, which asks what language the
        replacement is written in rather than comparing it to anything. It is
        the only one that catches a paraphrase: a review pass that rewrites
        "« D'où venez-vous ? »" as "Where are you from?" shares no run of
        words with the source and passes every text comparison above. With no
        `source_lang`, or one this table does not cover, it stands down.

        There is deliberately no check here that a `terminology` fix names a
        rendering the glossary lists. It was written and measured: over the
        three books in this workspace it blocked 414 edits, and two thirds of
        those were `consistency` errors about words the chunk's glossary has
        no entry for — real fixes dropped because their replacement was absent
        from an unrelated term's list. Deciding whether a reported span is
        about a term the glossary covers needs the span aligned to the source,
        which this pass does not have. A doubtful fix that is let through is
        recoverable in the review desk; a real one that is silently dropped is
        not.

        `dropped` is filled in, when given, with a count per reason that stopped an
        edit. It is reporting only: nothing here reads it, and a caller that
        passes nothing gets exactly the behaviour it had before.

        `agreed_targets` is the glossary renderings this run promised, and it
        exists for one guard: a `terminology`/`consistency` fix whose
        replacement is one of them is a rendering, not the source word put back,
        even when the two are the same string (`Rom => Rom`). Pass only the
